\Large\textbf{RITS System Architecture}
\end{center}

\vspace{1cm}
\noindent
RITS is accessible via two API calls:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{rits\_start(-Start)}\\\textbf{Start} is unified with a
  Prolog term that represents the initial state of RITS, before it has
  processed any user actions.

\item \textbf{rits\_next\_action(+A0, -A, +S0, -S)}\\
  This predicate relates a user action \textbf{A0} and a RITS state
  \textbf{S0} to the RITS action \textbf{A} and next state~\textbf{S}.
\end{itemize}

These predicates are completely \textit{pure}: They no not emit output
in any way, do not write any files, and do not query the user in any
way. Therefore, they can be quite safely executed in a hosting
environment.
