\vspace{1cm}

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{RITS is here to help.}\\
  The most important goal of RITS is to help students, teachers,
  administrators, parents, and all people involved in any way with
  education.

  \bigskip\noindent
  RITS helps \textit{students} to\dots
  \begin{itemize}
  \item \textit{understand} the subject material
  \item \textit{assess} their own knowledge and skills
  \item \textit{detect} and correct their misconceptions and blind spots.
  \end{itemize}

  \bigskip\noindent
  RITS helps \textit{teachers} to\dots
  \begin{itemize}
  \item \textit{reduce} their workload related to correcting and grading
    assignments, reporting individual and aggregated progress, \dots
  \item \textit{focus} on the many important tasks that will always require a
    human person: designing the curriculum and selecting assignments,
    connecting knowledge from different areas, explaining current
    events and pressing issues in today's world
  \end{itemize}
  \bigskip\noindent
  
  RITS helps \textit{administrators} to\dots
  \begin{itemize}
  \item \dots
  \end{itemize}

\item \textbf{The way is the goal, and vice versa.}\\
  Grades and assessments are only a means to an end, but not an end by
  themselves.

  Every interaction with RITS should lead to a better
  \textit{understanding} of the subject matter. RITS always
  \textit{accepts} a correct answer. When an answer is correct but not
  yet optimal, such as $\frac{2}{4}$ in the case of canceling
  fractions, RITS accepts the answer \textit{and leads the student} to
  the optimal solution.
