*) support 'Full "and" Fraction' syntax for fractions
*) use same language for exam situations as well as drilling/explanation?

    Options:

         - LORITS markers for informational texts, subproblems, guidance, ...
         - separate RITS actions for assessing correctness of an answer?

*) introduce LORITS element "wrong", which would implicitly call
   help_for_wrong_answer//3, followed by "again"?
